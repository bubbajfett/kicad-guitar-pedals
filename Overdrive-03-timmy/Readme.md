# Timmy clone


This is a clone of the Paul Cochrane Timmy overdrive.

This pedal is verified, though the layout is poor, IMHO.

It is the first pedal I did in Kicad, and it took 4 revisions
to get a working pedal, going all the way back to 2022.   This was
in the hall of shame box for some time.

v1:  pads for switch too small.   Changed to 2.5mm hole

v2:  RV2 is backwards from the tagboardeffects layout.   I.e.
the schematic has multiple issues.

Pedal has low volume.   Managed to get this to work correctly
via a series of bodges.  Also note te 3.3K resistor R2 is
diff in tagboardeffects layout 

v3:  Seems to work correctly.    Missing some values on
the silkscreen layer.


v4:  final version.
