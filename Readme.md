# Current guitar pedal projects

These pedals have been a learning exercise for me in KiCad. Any guitar pedal PCB published here has been built and tested. In some cases, more than two versions of boards have been created.

The main idea for doing my own PCB is to allow me to change the footprints and merge and/or hack pedal schematics to come up with new ideas. Unlike other commercial guitar pedal PCB creators, I am an amateur in this.   Also this has been a huge learning exercise.

Putting these pedal layouts out there for any interested party.

All have a gerbers/ subdir with the last gerber file I generated. Using OshPark for pcb generation.
