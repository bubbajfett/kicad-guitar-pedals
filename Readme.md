# Current guitar pedal projects

These pedals have been a learning exercise for me in KiCad. Any guitar pedal PCB published here has been built and tested. In some cases, more than two versions of boards have been created.

The main idea for doing my own PCB is to allow me to change the footprints and merge and/or hack pedal schematics to come up with new ideas.
The other reason is I am redoing my pedalboard to convert from side-jacks/veroboard layout to  top-jacks/pcbs.   I have gotten to dislike veroboard layouts.

I am an amateur in this.   Also this has been a huge learning exercise.    I;ve tried to be consistent
*   back of board mounted POTs
*   common format pinheader so to be able to use 4pin dupont connector or JST connector when building the
*   power on the top jack connector, with diode protection.
*   led on the stomp switch

Putting these pedal layouts out there for any interested party.

All have a gerbers/ subdir with the last gerber file I generated. Using OshPark for pcb generation.    They were done with Kicad 7.
