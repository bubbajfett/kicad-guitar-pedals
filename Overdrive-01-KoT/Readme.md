This is an overdrive pedal modeled after the King Of Tone pedal.   

Version 1 had error making the drive pot useless.    V1 was bodged by putting a link between pad2 of Rv1 (drive) to the 100k R6, and which is connected to pin1 of U1.  V3 removed the via from v2, and reversed the drive pot to match the schematic.

The current build seems to be fully functional.
